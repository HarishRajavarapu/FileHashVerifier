# 🚀 FREE TESTING MODE - File Hash Verifier dApp

## ✅ **Zero Cost Testing - No Blockchain Required!**

Your dApp is now configured for **completely free testing**! You can explore all the functionality without:

- ❌ No wallet connection required
- ❌ No gas fees or transaction costs
- ❌ No devnet/testnet tokens needed
- ❌ No smart contract deployment needed

## 🎯 **How Demo Mode Works**

### **Local Storage Simulation**

- Files are stored in your browser's localStorage
- All functionality is simulated locally
- No blockchain interaction required
- Perfect for testing and demonstrations

### **Full Feature Testing**

- ✅ File upload and SHA-256 hash calculation
- ✅ Hash storage and retrieval
- ✅ File integrity verification
- ✅ Verification count tracking
- ✅ Complete file management

## 🚀 **Quick Start - Zero Setup**

1. **Open the dApp**: The development server should be running at `http://localhost:5175/`
2. **Start Testing**: No wallet connection needed - just start using it!
3. **Upload Files**: Click "Store File Hash" and select any file
4. **Verify Files**: Upload the same file to verify integrity
5. **See Results**: View all stored files and their verification history

## 🎮 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: File Storage**

1. Select any file (document, image, etc.)
2. Click "Store Hash Locally (Free)"
3. See the file appear in the "Stored Files" section
4. Note the SHA-256 hash and metadata

### **Scenario 2: Successful Verification**

1. Upload the SAME file you just stored
2. Enter the exact filename
3. Click "Verify File Integrity (Free)"
4. See the success message ✅

### **Scenario 3: Tampering Detection**

1. Modify a file you previously stored (edit text, resize image, etc.)
2. Try to verify the modified file
3. See the failure message ❌ indicating tampering

### **Scenario 4: File Management**

1. Store multiple files with different names
2. View the complete list of stored files
3. See verification counts increase with each check
4. Clear all demo data when done testing
